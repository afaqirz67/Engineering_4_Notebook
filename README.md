## PYTHON DICE ROLLER

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if 
the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user 
was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without 
importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the 
program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some 
other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## PYTHON CALCULATOR
### Assignment Description

This assignment required prompting the user for two integers. Then out the sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulo of the integers using a function.

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection
This assignment was the first task of the year to use functions. It was a good recap of function definition. Functions are powerful tools that make the code look clean. It helps
break our program into smaller chunks. The code becomes much understandable. 

## QUADRATIC SOLVER
### Description
This assingment we had to code a program that would take three inputs and give out two outputs. The inputs are the coefficients and output is the roots which program gave out 
using the quadratic formula.

### Reflection
This was not a backbreaking assingment, but it was the first time I was using math equations. I might have had done it before too, but this was really centered on setting of the
equations so that took me a little time to figure out. Other than that the code was fun. Especially the function made the code realy clear. 

## STRINGS & LOOPS

### Assignment Description
This program prompts the user for a simple sentence. It splits and prints the each letter in that sentence in a new line using for loop and slpit function. The program takes the 
input as an array and then loops through each letter using the for loop. 

### Evidence

### Reflection
This was a relatively small looking program. Although, that couple lines of code does much more than it seems. It was a good practice on getting started with loops and in 
particular while loops. 

## CAD Swing Arm

### Assignment Description
This assignment asked me to replicate a swing arm part from a set of drawings. The assignment style is similar to a portion of the Onshape Associate Certification test.

### Reflection
Creating this part from a drawing was more difficult than I expected. Combining the different drawing views with the various dimensions took several tries. Even though the part 
was made with simple extrudes, they were combined in relatively complex ways. Next time, I will spend more time analyzing the drawings before I actually start making the part!

## Hangman
### Assignemnt Description
This assignment had asked for a program to play the hangman game on. The requirements were pretty clear. One player entered a word, and the second player would try to guess
the letters. With each wrong letter one part of the body would add to the hanging log. If all the body parts were drawn, player 1 would have won.

### Reflection
This assignment was relatively challenging to me since I hadn't gotten the entire logic of the program and how, when, and where each step occurred. Although, if the steps are
thought out, and the logic behind the code is understood before writing the code, it wouldn't be a hard task to get done. It would only be converting the logic to code. The code 
for this program includes usage of for loop, while loop, array, and simple if statements. The arrays were specifically crucial since there was much to do with letters
and specific spots of the letters. Although, to sum it up it was a good task to reuse all the skill sets learned in previous courses. 

## SKATEBOARD

### Assignment Description
This assignment had asked for sketching a skateboard and the instructions were relatively simple and step by step from Onshape itself. It had broken down every part into 
a separate section and all the steps were well described and the page also included short videos for every step.

### Evidence![Skateboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56890879/137754185-ee7d3e1e-953f-42db-8a32-9eaddb0acd07.png)

### Reflection
This assignment seemed to be hard, but the detailed instructions made it fairly simple. Although, it was time consuming due to the point that every step was so detailed and
there was a little extra description for one with some experience. The videos were also time consuming because they were non-skippable. Overall, other that sole issue,
everything else was pretty straight forward. I also took a couple extra steps and made the parts look real using the instructions. A better approach in doing assignments like
this would be doing it in your own way and use the descriptions only as needed.

## Lego
### Assignemnt Description
This assignment mainly targeted the importance and power of configurations and assembly of parts. It wanted us to create the lego part with multiple configurations that would, later on, be used in the assembly. Another critical skill it pointed out was drawings of sketches and demonstration of ways and techniques used in your work.

### Reflection
This assignment was somewhat easy, but at the same time pointed out the skill set that would reduce the time effort remarkably. Instead of creating eight different part
studios, one single block of lego, but with multiple configurations replaced. Using these methods will considerably affect time efficiency.

## RPi Led Blink
### Assignment Description
This was our primary task with raspberry pi involving extra hardware other then the pi board itself. The basic goal of this assignement was to get us fimiliar with how the pi
is used, how the pins on the board work and their functionalities; with it the specific task was to light two leds. One led had to read low voltaeg and the other read high at 
one specific point in timeline, meaning one led had to be one at a time. The past experience of playing with leds using arduino helped ease the work because the overall picture
is not that different.

### Reflection
Although I mentioned before that the overall idea behind this is similar to having it done with arduino as well, there are quiet a few things that are functioning different.
First is the programming language which is python here which is different than arduino. The raspberry pi board itself functions entirely different as of positioning of each
pin and its task. Despite some these opsticles everyting else was clear.

## RPi SAFE SHUTDOWN BUTTON
### Assingment Description
In this assignment we were suppose to get our raspberry pi a shutdown button, so that every time you need to shut it down which is a necessary component for having the pi not 
get fried. The button as the name of the assignment infers, shuts down the pi safely without having to shut the pi down with the shutdown scrpt "sudo shutdown -h now"every time
you would want to shut the pi down.

### Reflection
This assignment was pretty easy in regards of wirring, and the code wasn't that bad either. The task was easy, but it was probably the most useful in terms of easing the use of
RPi. For the wirring the purpose behind the it is to cut out the ground - that's basically how the code shuts it down. 

**3 NEW COMMANDS FROM RPi SAFE SHUTDOWN**
* subprocess.pOpen: This infers that we will be giving input and in return taking output
* stdout: Stores the output generated by subprocess.pOpen
* process.communicate: Reads the input & output of the processes 

## GPIO Pins I2C
### Assignment Description
This assignment required us to use an accelerometer sensor to display the x, y, and z axis acceleration on an OLED screen. The hardware part is simply wiring the oled, and the
accelerometer to the RPi, a three way connection. For the code part it was a mash up of two different programs, one sololy for the screen display and another for the axis 
calculations.

### Reflection
The assignment over all was a little difficult because I had hard time debugging the connection failiure I got from the RPi which I thought came from poor wiring. Lose wires
were part of the issue, but the real issue was in code. Another issue I encountered was when pushing to GitHubu I accedintly pulled and the previous version of my code somehow 
replaced my updated version and that caused some issues which had me spent extra time debuging the issue. 

## HEADLESS ACCELEROMETER
### Assignment Description
This assignnment is an add up to the previous assingment, the GPIO Pins which displayed the X, Y, and Z axis on an OLED screen. The task was to display the output graphically 
using shapes (a dot, bar, or line). The second part was to have the program run without having it be connected to a computer. Instead it was suppose to be powered by a battery 
and to have that work, some other modifications needed in the code.

### Reflection
The first part which was displaying the output graphically was not as hard. We got it pretty quick, but again, we encountered the same issue we had with GPIO Pins. The different
versions of the code were swapped back and forth, but the little experience from last time made it a quick fix. The second part was running the program without having it 
be connected to a computer and monitor. This was fairly easy and the only issue I encountered was naming my program. I named the service "headless_accelerometer.py.service" the 
same name as my file that had the code for the program. It might have not liked .py because when I created another service and renamed it "acceleration_bubble.service", it was 
working fine. So it was the .py or the state of having two dots in the name of the serviec that caused it to fail running. 


## Pi Camera
### Assignment Description
For this assignment we were tasked to use the RPi camera to take pictures. The hardware did not require a lot, it was just attaching the camera that is part of the RPi zero 
which we are using. The code was pretty simple too. The program had to take 5 pictures with different image effects. We used for loop for the reiteration and two sets of array,
one to store the image effects and another one for storing the images, so that each image does not overlap the other.

### Reflection
The wasn't a lot of trouble shooting in this program, but one thing that got me was the second array which was for saving each image it takes and save it with a different name.
For storing an image I had to define the formate of the elements in the array. For images I used 'nameYouWantitStoredAs.jpg'.
## COPYPASTA
### Assignment Description
This is assignment required us to use the RPi camera to take pictures and make a video with it. The program had to run in a while loop so that you could take as many pictures 
as you want with pressing a push button and exit the loop with keyboard interuption.
