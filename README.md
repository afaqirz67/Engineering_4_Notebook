## PYTHON DICE ROLLER

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if 
the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user 
was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without 
importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the 
program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some 
other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## PYTHON CALCULATOR
### Assignment Description

This assignment required prompting the user for two integers. Then out the sum, difference, quotient, product, and modulo of the integers using a function.

### Reflection
This assignment was the first task of the year to use functions. It was a good recap of function definition. Functions are powerful tools that make the code look clean. It helps
break our program into smaller chunks. The code becomes much understandable. 

## QUADRATIC SOLVER
### Description
This assingment we had to code a program that would take three inputs and give out two outputs. The inputs are the coefficients and output is the roots which program gave out 
using the quadratic formula.

### Reflection
This was not a backbreaking assingment, but it was the first time I was using math equations. I might have had done it before too, but this was really centered on setting of the
equations so that took me a little time to figure out. Other than that the code was fun. Especially the function made the code realy clear. 

## STRINGS & LOOPS

### Assignment Description
This program prompts the user for a simple sentence. It splits and prints the each letter in that sentence in a new line using for loop and slpit function. The program takes the 
input as an array and then loops through each letter using the for loop.

### Reflection
This was a relatively small looking program. Although, that couple lines of code does much more than it seems. It was a good practice on getting started with loops and in 
particular while loops.
